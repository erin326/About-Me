# About Me

Hi all! I'm a full stack Software Engineer with a passion for React JS and Ruby on Rails. I love building full applications on my own. I also enjoy working with fellow developers and helping each other grow/learn. I attended Flatiron School and received a certificate of completion in their Software Engineer Certificate Program. I learned so much at Flatiron, from programming technologies and languages to strategic error handling. In addition to Ruby on Rails and React/ Javascript, I'm also experienced with CSS, HTML, Git, Heroku, ActiveRecord, SQL and more. Feel free to reach out to me if you like to connect and talk code, or even collaborate on a project!
